# How to set up server
You can download the Sleuth installer from the releases and run "sleuth" in the command line, but you can also build it, here is how:
```
git clone https://github.com/Unzor/sleuth
cd sleuth
npm i
node server
```

# How to connect
You can either:
- Use the GUI (Visit https://sleuth-connect.glitch.me to connect to a Sleuth server. (Make sure to add port 3000 if it is a port-forwarded public IP address))
- Use the JavaScript [Sleuth API](https://github.com/Unzor/sleuth/tree/main/api)

# Note
Sleuth may not work with .exe or other encrypted files, but a fix will be made to fix this issue.
